        <h1>Graffiti Hunt: A Scavenger Hunt App</h1>
        <p>A UX Design Case Study</p>
        <p>April 2018-January 2019</p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div id="project">
      <div class="container">
        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>
          Graffiti Hunt is a twist on the way traditional scavenger hunting apps are played. It focuses on graffiti and street art that can be found within their own city, providing a fun and engaging way to spend spare time. This project was
          completed for CareerFoundry’s Certified UX Design program.
        </p>

        <h2>Purpose and Context</h2>
        <p>
          The purpose was to explore ways to create a scavenger hunt game that can be scaled upward to any supported location and involve any of your friends through social sharing. I was required to follow a certain set of design criteria, but was
          able to put a spin on the traditional scavenger hunt if I wished. This project had a duration of 8 months.
        </p>

        <h2>Understanding the Problem</h2>
        <p>
          <ul>
            <li>Many scavenger hunts lack variety and focus on crowded places or tourist attractions.</li>
            <li>Players often become fixated on the next object or clue, causing them to be distracted and lack awareness of their surroundings.</li>
          </ul>
        </p>

        <h2>Potential Solutions</h2>
        <p>
          <ul>
            <li>Encourage users to broaden their horizons and learn more about the culture they live in.</li>
            <li>Provide more variety in their gaming experience.</li>
            <li>Lead users to hidden gems and unique places.</li>
          </ul>
        </p>

        <h2>Competitive Analysis</h2>
        <p>
          A competitive analysis was conducted with 3 other scavenger hunt apps: Munzee, Big City Hunt, and Geocashing. This was done to better position my app in the market, and see what makes these other apps work. I reviewed their marketing
          strategies and advantages, objectives and UX. A SWOT (Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities and Threats) was conducted to give myself a visual representation of the research I gathered for each app.
        </p>

        <h2>User Interviews</h2>
        <p>
          I conducted user interviews with 4 participants to further understand:
        </p>
        <p>
          <ol>
            <li>how often people participate in scavenger hunts, and what holds them back from participating in more;</li>
            <li>what users find the most enjoyable and most frustrating about scavenger hunting apps, and why;</li>
            <li>what types of features they felt like scavenger hunts were lacking;</li>
            and
            <li>if a twist on what a traditional scavenger hunt is would intrigue users and motivate them to participate more in my scavenger hunt.</li>
          </ol>
        </p>
        <p>
          I identified the users’ needs and goals, behaviors and attitudes, frustrations, general facts about them and quotes. This helped me to develop my user personas and identify the major pain points in current scavenger hunting apps.
        </p>

        <h2>User Personas</h2>

        </picture>

        <h2>User Journey Maps</h2>
        <p>
          User journey maps were created to dive deeper into my personas and to help provide me with a deeper understanding of user motivations and thought processes, along with the emotional context in which they’re using the product. <span> I broke
            down the phases of the user journeys by developing scenarios where they might use the product. I listed the <b>primary tasks</b> my personas would take, made speech bubbles to list the <b>thoughts</b> the user personas might have and
            finally, created a way to demonstrate their <b>emotional experience</b>, which in my case takes the form of a line moving through all phases of the process. During some phases, the user is shown as emotionally “high,” while in other
            phases, when faced with setbacks or hurdles, for example, they may become emotionally “low.” </span>

        </picture>

        <h2>Sitemap</h2>
        <p>
          I originally created a sitemap that had primary navigation as: Hunts, Social, Messages, Profile and Menu. I wanted to test if potential users felt that the primary navigation should be displayed this way as well. To do this, I conducted an
          <b>open card sort</b> (using OptimalSort) with 10 participants and 30 different cards. I asked each user to group the cards that they feel should go together, and then name each group.<span> The results proved that the majority of users
            felt that the main navigation pages should be: <b>Hunts, Social, Messages</b> and <b>Profile</b>. Below is my updated Sitemap that displays these changes.</span>

        <h2>Rapid Prototyping</h2>
        <p>
          I wanted to get my ideas on paper at this stage, as I felt that the research gathered was enough to give me a pretty good visual representation of the structure of the app. For this stage, my method was rapid prototyping of paper sketches.
          It helped me to visualize what the app would look like, and begin preparing for the next round of mockups.

        <h2>Mid-Fidelity Prototypes</h2>
        <p>
          After getting my paper sketches down, I created mid-fidelity wireframes to prepare for a round of usability testing. I wanted to see how the designs resonated with potential users, and if any changes needed to be made before moving on to
          the high fidelity prototypes.

        <h2>Usability Testing</h2>
        <h3>Key Findings</h3>
        <p>
          I performed a usability test with 5 participants in separate sessions to determine if they were able to easily navigate through the app for the first time and perform specific tasks. I recorded each session with the permission of the
          participant, to ensure that I could pay close attention to them and not get distracted by taking too many notes. I encouraged each participant to think aloud as they were doing each task, so that I could have a clear understanding of their
          pain points, keep track of their errors, likes and dislikes and general observations.<span> I asked each user to perform 4 simple tasks by navigating through the app:</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          <ol>
            <li>You are a first-time user and want to create an account. Please create an account and log in through the app.</li>
            <li>You are getting a few of your friends together to participate in a scavenger hunt this weekend. You want to browse available hunts and save them for later. </li>
            <li>You’ve saved a couple of hunts and want to let your friends know about these hunts you found. Using Graffiti Hunt, reach out to your friends and see if they like any of your options.</li>
            <li>It’s the weekend and you’re with your friends. You’re ready to play that hunt you just saved and want to begin. Using Graffiti Hunt, start playing your game.</li>
          </ol>
        </p>
        <p>
          The results of these tests showed that I needed to modify my app a bit to make it more usable. I moved the “messaging” feature from the Profile to the Social page; the footer icons were modified to be better recognizable; I created a map
          feature on the home page; I made the filter option more customizable.

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>
      With this being my first UX Design project, the main takeaway was that communication with your users is key. Your users may point out a plethora of usability issues that you would have never known if you didn't take the time to listen to each
      users' feedback and make adjustments. There is so much more to good design than a product that looks appealing at first glance. To build a lasting product, you must always put the user first and never forget who you are making the product for
      in the first place.
